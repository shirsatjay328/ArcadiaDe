This includes residential use, educational institutions, rehabilitation centers, and temporary climbing installations at events or outdoor festivals. While these applications may account for a smaller portion of the market, they represent a growing niche driven by the increasing popularity of climbing as a fitness activity and recreational pursuit. For instance, residential installations, such as home climbing walls or small-scale setups, are becoming more common as individuals seek to engage in climbing at home. The mats used in these installations need to be compact, durable, and easy to set up. Moreover, in educational institutions, climbing walls are increasingly being incorporated into physical education curricula, necessitating the use of high-quality climbing mats.
