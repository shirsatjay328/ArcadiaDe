First, the rising incidence of anxiety and panic disorders worldwide is driving the need for effective medications. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), anxiety disorders affect millions of people globally, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia. These disorders are characterized by excessive worry, fear, and panic attacks, necessitating pharmaceutical interventions. In response to the growing demand for effective treatments, pharmaceutical companies are focusing on developing new drugs with improved efficacy and fewer side effects. Key drug classes, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), benzodiazepines, and other newer drugs, are expected to see increased adoption. The demand for personalized medicine, aimed at tailoring treatments based on individual genetic profiles, is also expected to provide significant growth opportunities.
