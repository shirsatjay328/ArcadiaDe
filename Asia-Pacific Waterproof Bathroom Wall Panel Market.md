The household application refers to the use of waterproof wall panels in residential properties. Homeowners are increasingly opting for these panels due to their ability to withstand the humid and damp environment of bathrooms. Waterproof panels not only provide a practical solution to the issue of water damage but also offer a modern and aesthetically pleasing finish to bathrooms. In addition, these panels are available in a variety of designs, textures, and colors, giving homeowners the flexibility to customize their bathroom space. As the demand for home renovation and remodeling continues to rise across the Asia-Pacific region, the household segment is expected to dominate the market.<p>The commercial segment, on the other hand, encompasses the use of waterproof bathroom wall panels in a variety of business settings. This includes hotels, resorts, restaurants, hospitals, and office buildings where durability and hygiene are crucial. Commercial establishments prioritize the longevity and low-maintenance nature of waterproof bathroom wall panels, as they can handle heavy traffic and frequent use.
